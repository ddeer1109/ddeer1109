- 👋 Hi, I am Daniel
- 🌱 I work as Software Engineer in large Swiss Investment Bank
- 🏋🏻‍♀️ Technologies used on daily-basis: Java 11, Angular, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS Azure, GitLab + GitLab CI and a lot of inside systems
- ✨ I have finished intense 12-Month Fullstack Developer Bootcamp. First half of course I had been learning full time, then I received work offer as Junior Application Support Role. After 3 months I've been horizontally promoted to Junior Software Engineer position. After 4 months of work I've got promoted to Regular Software Engineer role due good performance and taking large amount of new resposibilites after my Senior collegue leave 
- 👀 Since my work's start in December I stopped to work on projects on this profile - mainly Codecool related projects developed for learning purposes + one large project of my idea "BWell" - application with nutrition module, communicating with 3rd part API with Nutrients details and with 4 repositories of ideas from area of: diet, fitness, relaxation and self-development
